RealTimePolling
===============

This is the start of a real-time polling application utilizing the Meteor.js framework (still currently in development). 

THE PROBLEM:
We wanted to poll people at a large event in the quickest way possible to gather anonymous, simple, multiple-choice type responses. 

THE SOLUTION:
There were several "pollsters" walking around with tablets displaying a webpage from this application with the poll questions on it (basic, multiple-choice responses).  As the data was entered, a seperate screen updated in real-time with the results. 

This set utilized the Meteor.js framework and simple custom HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end development.
